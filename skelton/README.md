# Skelton's Simple Shoe Selector
## Two REST API

### Startup:
*Ensure that you are on the "angular2rest" branch and in the "skelton" directory.
* ``` npm install ``` will load the package.json.
* A "data" directory will automatically be generated (for the MongoDB).
* ```gulp``` will run the required build processes.
* Simple Shoe Selector uses Mongo, MongoDB, Express, Node and HTTPie. If you are unfamiliar with any of these, please review their respective documentation.

### Use:
you will need to use HomeBrew to install HTTPie.
Open four terminal windows.
* TERM 1: mongod --dbpath=./db - this will show that it's listening on 27017
* TERM 2: mongo - this will show the mongo command line
* TERM 3: node index - will begin running the database code. Note the port that the server says it's running on. My default is 3030; yours may be different.
* TERM 4: (optional, see below) command line. Use HTTPie to enter database commands: http POST localhost:3030/api/(route).  Route can be either pants or shoes.

### Alternative use
If you'd like to use the Angular interface, do the following:
* Leave Terminals 1-3 open
* In a fourth terminal change directories to the /lib directory
* In the lib directory type ``` node client-server ```
* The terminal should respond with "client server up on 5000"
* Enter localhost:5000 in your browser URL bar. The Angular framework instantly updates the database when you add, update or delete an entry.

### Data entry
* Pants Schema:
'fabric', 'cut' and 'color' are the three criteria for pants. 'Cut' defaults to 'slacks'.

* Shoes Schema:
'brand', 'type', 'color', slipOn, and 'polish' are the criteria for shoes. 'slipOn' defaults to 'false', 'type' defaults to 'Oxfords' and 'polish' defaults to 'dress'.

### Something useful
Once shoes and pants data has been entered into the db, head over to localhost:3030/wardrobe to find out how many possible shoes/pants combinations you can make.
